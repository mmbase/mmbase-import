In order build MMBase into your own webapplication, you must do the following:

1. Download and install a Java Development Kit

2. Download and install the Ant Binary Distribution (Ant 1.4 is required)

3. Choose one of the Ant-targets, eg bindist which will build a
   complete binary distribution, and start ant with this target ('ant
   bindist'). See 'ant -projecthelp' for more information about the
   different targets.

4. Ant will now download all needed packages, unpacks them and will
   start building mmbase. All the output from the build proces
   (downloaded packages, compiled classes, jars, etc) can be found in
   <mmbase-src/build>.
   
   You can avoid downloading by putting mmbase-downloads.zip next to
   build.xml. 

5. Now you can install MMBase using the installation.txt
