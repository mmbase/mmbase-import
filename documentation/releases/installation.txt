                     MMBase 1.6 - Installation
===================================================================  
  
MMBase is distributed as a webapplication, it's not packaged as a .war
file, but the structure is the same. In order to install and get
MMBase running, you must do the following:

1. Download and install a Java Development Kit.

2. Download and install a Servlet Engine or an Applicationserver
   (check if the Servlet Engine is up and running and if you can use
   the jsp-examples), see releasenotes for tested Servlet Engines.

3. Download and install ImageMagick. See note below if you're having
   problems with Imagemagick or don't want to use it.

4. Copy (not in all cases symlinking would work) the subdir
   mmbase-webapp into the servlet-engine's
   webapp dir. Most 'SCAN' applications would require this webapp to
   be the ROOT webapp (the SCAN editors of this version also work in
   another contextes).

   Some details can't autodetect the context in which MMBase is
   running (like gui-functions of images), so it adviced to
   explicitely inform MMBase with the mmbase.htmlrooturlpath context
   parameter from web.xml (This is not necessary for modern
   app-servers like Tomcat 4.1)

5. Edit
   <mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/applications/Resources/builders/images.xml>
   for the location of ImageMagick's convert tool. If it is your PATH
   it will perhaps also work with default settings.  

6. The directory <mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/builders/applications>
   must be writable for the Servlet Engine if you want to auto-install
   builders. 

7. Start servlet-engine if you want to use the default MMBase-config
   (uses a hsqldb-database), or goto step 10 for changing default
   configuration. 

8. Check if mmbase is running using the following url:
   <http://localhost:port/version> 

9. If this is running, goto <http://localhost:port> to see an infopage
   about MMBase and links to editors, admin, examples, etc. Use
   admin/admin2k when you're asked to login (see notes below how to
   change this).

10. Edit jdbc.xml and mmbaseroot.xml (both are in
   <mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/modules>) for using a different
   database (see releasenotes for tested databases), or change other
   settings (servername, multicast, etc). 
   Other interesting settings can be found in
   <mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/security/context/config.xml> (users,
   groups, and contextes), and in
   <mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/log/log4j.xml> (logfile configuration
   and so on)

11. If you have any kind of problem goto:
   website: <http://www.mmbase.org/>
   irc: #mmbase at slashnet


Some final notes:
=================
Scan: 
Scan has been 'turned off' by default in this release because it has
been deprecated. It can be used and this is what needs to be done to
get it working:

 - Make the following MMBase modules active:
    * calc (math)
    * info (system info commands)
    * mmbase (basic SCAN commands)
    * mmedit (for the SCAN editors)
    * mmlanguage (prompts for the SCAN editors)
    * scanparser (essential parser)
    * session (maintain user info)
 - Optionally, you can activate the modules:
    * scancache (caching of SCAN pages)
    * transactionhandler (transactions through xml)

 - In the web.xml, add the SCAN servlet (scanserv). Also add the
   mapping for SCAN pages (*.shtml).
   The default web.xml of MMBase contains example code which you can
   uncomment. 
 - Restart your server.

To make a module active, find the modulename.xml file in the modules
directory of the MMBase configuration. In the file, change the
'status' from inactive to active, and save the file.

Jikes:
If you'd like to develop jsp and taglib pages at a usable speed it is
recommended to install jikes for compiling jsp. See your
Servlet-engine's documentation about how to do this.

Security:
If your going to use the jsp-editors you need to check out the
<mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/security> dir, to customize the security
settings. 

If you're going to use the scan editors you need to deploy the
BasicAuth-application (you can do this from the admin-pages). This
will create some relations. You have to change the property authtype
from mmbaseroot.xml into basic and after this restart MMBase. You can
now create people and related editors to them. Every people you create
needs to have an account and password in the
<mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/accounts.properties> file. These people
can now use the editors.

ImageMagick:
Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
this by changing the properties in
<mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/builders/images.xml> into:

<properties> 
  <property name="ImageConvertClass">
    org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI 
  </property> 
  <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property> 
</properties>

Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerfull when
using JAI instead of Imagemagick.
