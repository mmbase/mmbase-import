                     MMBase 1.8.6 - Release Notes
===================================================================

============
INTRODUCTION:
============

This document describes the changes that have been made in the final
release of MMBase 1.8.6, relative to the previous release of MMBase (1.7.x).

Bug reports should be entered at the bug reporting system for MMBase
at:

<http://www.mmbase.org/jira>

1.8.6 is a bug fix release with a few minor new features.


Note: The 1.8.5 version of MMBase was the first distro of MMBase which is partly compiled with
      java 1.5. These are the following shipped applications:
      michiel@mitulo:~/mmbase/release$  for i in 'applications/email' 'contributions/lucene' 'contributions/mmbob' 'contributions/thememanager'  'applications/richtext'         'applications/jumpers' 'applications/commandserver' 'applications/notifications' 'contributions/poll' 'contributions/calendar'     ; do     cvs -q update -d -P -A $i ;     done
      which are taken from CVS HEAD, and are no more maintained in the 1.8 branch of MMBase itself



      We don't build documentation any more, we refer to http://www.mmbase.org/mmdocs for up-to-date
      version of the documentation, or the build of HEAD for a downloadable version.


Note: Since 1.8.6 the default clustering message format is no any more compatible with mmbase 1.7
      implementations.
      If you need that, set the 'mmbase17.compatible' property on the clustering module explicetly
      back to true.

[1.8.3]

[1.8.2]
[1.8.1]
- postgresql with views

- several small taglib improvements, like
    - an mm:mayread

    - easier to use when reusing the request (dynamic includes).  E.g. if logicaly no mm:cloud
      needed because the object has a cloud already (e.g. on reuse of a node), then it works without
      errors now.

    - jspvar on querycontainers

    - timezone on locale-tags.

    - styleClass on mm:form

    - Jsp included with mm:include or jsp:include now inherit content tag property from the including jsps.
      An included jsp can no longer override the cache settings of the including jsp.

- improved date-parsing  (also in mm:time)

- clustering implementations have been reviewed, added e.g. 'admin pages' for clustering


[1.8.0]
- Applications:
  Code in mmbase is more clearly separated in 'core' and 'applications'.

  Some code has moved to a separate application:
   - Vwms (virtual web masters) have been removed from the core and placed in a
     separate 'vwms' application.
   - SCAN is now a separate application. The application depends on the vwms
     application.

  New applications:
   - Crontab is a new application that provides scheduling.

   - Oscache-cache is a new application that implements the MMBase cache using oscache
     (shipped in distro)

   - Packaging is an application that offers an alternative for the sharing and distribution of
     'packages' of mmbase code and data.
     (stalled)

   - Richtext application provides support for kupu-editor, and we basicly have 'rich text' now,
     including inline urls, attachments, images, cross-links and 'blocks' (notes, intermezzo's)

- Security improvements:
   - Class security provides authentication wrapping based on calling class
     -> classauthentication.xml

   - It's easier to make security independent code because of new features about default authentication
     methods.

- Images improvements
   - Support for height and width (predicted before conversion, determined after conversion, and
     stored if corresponding fields are available) (This was ported to 1.7.4 too)
	 'modes' of mm:image.

   - Transformations are postponed to when actually served --> with new image-servlet it is possible to
     set up separate image server.

   - FileName of upload can be stored, and be added to the URL (/mmbase/attachments/1234/myfile.pdf)

- ResourceLoader was created, MMBase can more easily be deployed as war now. Most configuration can also
  be shipped inside jars, and be overriden. This means the most applications can principally be installed by
  placing one jar in WEB-INF/lib plus placing jsp's if any.
  --> Some resources are 'mergeable' now

- DataTypes and Field improvements.
   New datatypes 'datetime' and 'boolean'. Support for 'restrictions' on all types, default values,
   uniqueness etc. All on field level.

   DataType 'list' is not yet tested/working.

   This gave rise to complete new package org.mmbase.datatypes which is also part of 'bridge'
   because its classes are accessible through several methods in bridge.

   --> 'typehandlers' of taglib are based on datatypes now.
   --> DateParser
   --> updated builder xml format (using XSD)

- Functions. The function framework was completed. Among others you can now add functions in the
  builder xml (without the need to override the builder class).

- Events. Because of the 'cache release strategy' project, event object were created (in
  org.mmbase.core.events). Work is being done release-strategies. You can also implement different
  cache-backings --> e.g. oscache-impl of Johannes.

- Several new methods on bridge. -> see api-doc

- Tests. The junit test-cases will all succeed when we release 1.8.

- Contributions:   aselect,  mmbar,  mmbob, multilanguagegui, thememanager, lucene

- External libraries:  concurrency support (anticipating jdk 1.5)
                       we ship jstl/standard

- Support for oracle / mssql. views.

- Definition of 'bridge': The classes in mmbase-rmmci.jar.

- Clustering is pluggable: clustering application: jgroups, unicast, multicast.

- Optimization: The optimizationproject has made some progress, and quite a lot dissappeared. Most
  noticably the multitude of database layers. There's just one now.
  TODO:  Additional work remains, specifically fasing out of deprecated methods, renaming of
  classes, improvement of performance, and the simplifixation (or elimination) of JDBC module
  in favor of a stand-alone datasource implementation.

- maven build. This is not an improvement on the MMBase code itself, but an alternative
  for the current ant build system. The maven build does not yet build everything the current ant
  build does. The core and frequently-used applications are build by maven. The maven build provides
  an eady way to use MMBase artifacts in custom projects. The maven mmbase-modules plugin creates
  mmbase-module artifacts which include jars, config files, templates and examples. The plugin
  can also add these mmbase-module artifacts into a war artifact (see the example-webapp).

- Better blob-caching.
  - Support for InputStreams.

- cp1252 work arounds. (also in 1.7.x)

- Core improvements:
   - MMObjectNode can now be serialized

- query-logging: max-life-time setting.

Taglib New Features:
-------------------
- Bunch of new tags/attributes (see documentation). E.g. more complete set of has- tags
 (hasnodemanager, hasfunction etc..)

- FileItem. HttpPost useage was dropped. common fileupload's 'FileItem' can be gotten as a jspvar.

- Compatibility with EL. MMBase Taglib variables are now EL variables.
  This may give minor compatibility issues. If this gives too many issues for you, you can switch
  this behaviour off (this needs some testing still though).

- 'escapers' can be more easily added, and they can also be configured on the page (mm:escaper)
  This uses the concept of TransformerFactories and so on. A bit similar to functions.

- EditTag


Editwizard New Features:
------------------------

- Several small improvements

- The editwizard are about to receive a refactoring, which is anticipated for 1.8.1

--------------------
Obsolete Features:
--------------------
[1.8.0]
- The 'ObjectTypes' class is merged into the 'TypeDef' class. Old code
  referencing ObjectTypes should reference TypeDef instead. This includes the
  typedef.xml builder configuration file.

- The storage configuration files were originally located in the mmbase.jar.
  In 1.8, these files have been moved to the storage/database directory in the mmbase config
  directory. Files that override the storage configuration need to be moved to the new directory.

- The 'Config' module and the 'AppTool' utility have been dropped from the
  code. Both tools provided visual input regarding configuration or
  application makeup, but were considered outdated.
  References to these modules have been removed from the MMBase admin pages.

- Old database layers have been dropped.

- 1.8 assumes that relation builders are extended from insrel (using the extends attribute in the builder tag).
  Code may behave erratically if your relation builder xmls are not configured to use inheritence.
  See upgrade.txt on how to adapt your configuration.

---------------------------------------------------------
Known API incompatibilities of bridge, between 1.7 and 1.8.
---------------------------------------------------------
Of course we try to mimimize this, but sometimes it happens...

- org.mmbase.bridge.Cloud#getUser().getRank() does not return a String any more, but an actual Rank
  object --> cloud.getUser().getRank().equals(Rank.ANONYMOUS.toString()); still compiles but doesn't work any
  more!!
  So, grep your code for that. And see that the change is, though incompatible, a real
  improvement... Quickest fixes are to change getUser().getRank() by getUser().getRank().toString(),
  or remove the 'toString()' on the compared Rank-constant.


- Node#setValue("owner", ..) does no longer throw an exception.

- Empty fields of a node in a Transaction behave excactly like empty fields of a node which is not in
  a Transaction. In previous versions there could be a difference, more specificly with 'not null'
  fields (which for example could still be null in a node which is only commited in the transaction,
  and not yet to the database).

- Processors have been moved to org.mmbase.datatypes.processors (from
  org.mmbase.bridge.util.fields).
  If you used those in 1.7, then you need to recompile, and reconfigure in datatypes.xml.


- Implement 'node' functions on bridge, not core. This ensure awareness, and that functions can be
  called through MMCI. It seems a bit odd to use node interfaces in an otherwise core context, but
  functions are exposed through the bridge, and exposing core object to the outside is even odder.


- MMBase.getConnection was dropped. This can be replaced by:
  import javax.sql.*;
  import org.mmbase.storage.implementation.database.Attributes;
  DataSource dataSource = (DataSource) mmbase.getStorageManagerFactory().getAttribute(Attributes.DATA_SOURCE);
     return dataSource.getConnection();
 }


-  The getChildElement methods on DocumentReaders (like XMLBasicReader) don't return Enumerations
   any more but Iterators

-  MMBase.mmobjs has been made private.

========================
Know Issues and Problems:
========================


- If your app-server supports JSP2.0 (e.g. tomcat5 with a 'new'
  web.xml or resin 3), then the new EL (Expression Language) syntax
  collides with the Expression language of mmbase taglib.

  MMBase Taglib JSP's using the ${} syntax might continue to work, provided it follows EL syntax.
  Some of the more complex expressions may not work - specifically those where multiple contaxt variables
  are used in one expression.
  If expressions fail to work udner EL, either replace ${...} expressions with the alternate (non EL)
  syntax: $[...], or add <%@page isELIgnored="true" %> to the page to turn off EL.

- Orion version < 2.x doesn't support the final servlet api 2.3,
  because of this the jumpersFilter will not work. You will need to
  remove the following lines from <WEB-INF/web.xml>:

    <!-- Filter for jumpers -->
    <filter>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <display-name>Jumpers Filter</display-name>
      <description>Filter used for jumpers</description>
      <filter-class>org.mmbase.servlet.JumpersFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>

    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

  And replace them with:

    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>servjumpers</servlet-name>
      <display-name>servjumpers</display-name>
      <servlet-class>org.mmbase.servlet.servjumpers</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-filter url-pattern="/*" servlet-name="servjumpers" />

  (I'm not sure where the last line has to be: web.xml or orion-web.xml).


- Length of email field inside Users and People builder isn't
  rfc-compliant, but with 255 it stays beyond a limit some databases
  use before switching to a bigger string-type (eg clob).

- Not all HTML is html4 or xhtml valid

- Sometimes it is needed to copy xml-apis.jar to
  <$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/> or $ORION_HOME, eg if you're doing
  xslt-transformation or if you're using the editwizards.

- Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
  use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
  this by changing the properties in

   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/builders/applications/images.xml (after installation of 'Resource')
   or
   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/applications/Resources/builders/images.xml (before installation of 'Resource')

   into:

  <properties>
    <property name="ImageConvertClass">
      org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI
    </property>
    <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property>
  </properties>

  Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerful when
  using JAI instead of Imagemagick.

- Jumpers jump to /index.html by default, which can e.g. shield the
  image servlet (if 'dotlessly' mapped). Remove the setting from
  jumpers.xml if you prefer nice 404's (this is like this on default)

- Hsqldb uses the current dir for writing the database-files. This can
  be the bin dir from where you're starting the servlet-engine. You
  can change this to a dir you want, by changing the database-property
  in jdbc.xml (perhaps using $DATADIR)

- Resin provides its own XSL-transformation implementation, on this
  area are some known problems.

- Resin cannot swallow some of the larger jsp/taglib pages.


============
Requirements:
============

MMBase needs an servlet engine which supports the servlet api 2.3 and
jsp api 1.2. Furthermore it needs a database and a jdbc-driver.

The 'bin' distro does include a hsqldb database and driver.
