The last stable version of MMBase was 1.9

SNAPSHOTS are now build with github actions and published to sonatype. It uses https://github.com/mmbase/docker[this docker image] to provide the necessary environment for that.

I'll try to make minor release soon, so all artifacts have a version  on maven central.

See also https://www.mmbase.org/[website].

== Build locally

MMBase might need some tools during tests. E.g. ImageMagick, FFMpeg.

It was on java 5 before MMBase 9.7, but that is not supported anymore. It works now on java 8, but even that might be a bit cumbersome nowadays.

So there is a https://github.com/mmbase/docker/build[docker image that contains all the necessary tools to build MMBase] which is also used in the github actions.

=== Act?
So, to build locally you could try out https://github.com/nektos/act[act] to avoid having to arrange everything yourself. Just install docker and act.

It seems that act isn't well maintained?

== Just start docker

See link:Makefile[Makefile] for some examples how to start MMBase build in docker.
[source, bash]

michiel@mitulo:(MMBase-1_9,9)~/github/mmbase/mmbase$ make help
These commands can be used to build MMBase in docker (but without act)
'make mvn'
help                           Show this help.
mvn                            run mvn build (actually build-all.sh) via docker
bash                           gives a shell on build build, which current directory mounted
